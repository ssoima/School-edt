NOTES
=====
This application is intended solely for the purpose of demonstrating
AF_INET/SOCK_STREAM (aka TCP sockets) in the lecture GRNVS [1]. It is by no way
"perfect" code but represents a minimalistic yet fully functional example.

These sources were developed from the tcpchat_client during lecutre.


HOWTO BUILD
===========
To build tcp_chatclient just type "make" in the root source directory (gcc must
be installed). The application is tested under Debian/GNU Linux (grml) and
MacOSX 10.8 (Xcode must be installed).


HOWTO RUN
=========
To keep the source code short and clear, this application does not use things
such as getopt() to parse command line arguments. Instead you have to call

./tcp_chatclient <server IP> <remote port>

with the arguments in exactly that order.
